<h2>My Favorite HobbieS</h2>
<p>First I am going to talk about my favorite hobbie and why I like them.</p>

<h2>My Family</h2>
<p>I live with my parents and I do not have any siblings, so sometimes it can be very boring with no one to play with.</p>
<p> Another fact about my family that you might not know about me is the fact that my mom is Japanese while my dad is Chinese</p>
